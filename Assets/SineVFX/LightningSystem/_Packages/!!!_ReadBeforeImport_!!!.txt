1. Unpack the right package for your pipeline and don't unpack the other, pick only one.

2. After unpacking, check the "SineVFX/LightningSystem/Scenes/DemoScene" and test the effects. Also, read the Quick Start Guide for each specific System in the _Documentation folder.

3. If you using URP make sure, you enable HDR, Depth, and Opaque textures in URP Asset settings.

4. For better visual results use Linear Rendering instead of Gamma. You can choose it in a "Project Settings/Player" menu
